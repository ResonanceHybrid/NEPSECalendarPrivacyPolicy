    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Your privacy is important to us.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="card">
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>NEPSE Calendar ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our mobile application that provides Nepal Stock Exchange (NEPSE) event information.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="card">
    <h2>Information We Do NOT Collect</h2>
    <p>NEPSE Calendar is designed with privacy in mind. We do NOT directly collect, store, or process any of the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Personal identification information</li>
      <li>Contact information (email, phone numbers)</li>
      <li>Location data or GPS coordinates</li>
      <li>Financial information or investment data</li>
      <li>Login credentials or authentication data</li>
      <li>User behavior analytics or tracking data</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  
  <div class="card">
    <h2>Advertising</h2>
    <p>NEPSE Calendar displays advertisements through Google AdMob to support the free app. Google AdMob may collect certain information for advertising purposes:</p>
    
    <h3>Information collected by Google AdMob:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Device identifiers (Advertising ID)</li>
      <li>Device information (model, operating system)</li>
      <li>Network information (IP address)</li>
      <li>Ad interaction data (views, clicks)</li>
      <li>Approximate location (based on IP address)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>This data is used solely by Google to display relevant ads and measure ad performance. We do not have access to this information.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="card">
    <h2>Local Data Storage</h2>
    <p>The app stores NEPSE event data locally on your device for offline functionality. This data includes only public NEPSE event information (dates, event names, types) and contains no personal information. This data is stored solely on your device and is not transmitted to any external servers.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="card">
    <h2>Internet Connection</h2>
    <p>The app requires an internet connection to fetch the latest NEPSE event and to display advertisements through Google AdMob. When offline, the app functions using previously downloaded data. No personal data is transmitted during these connections.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="card">
    <h2>Push Notifications</h2>
    <p>To keep you updated with the latest NEPSE offerings and important announcements, we use push notifications through OneSignal service. Here's what you should know:</p>
    
    <h3>What we collect for notifications:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>A unique device token (to identify your device for sending notifications)</li>
      <li>Basic device information (device type and operating system)</li>
      <li>Notification preferences and delivery status</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Important notes:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>You can turn off notifications anytime in your device settings</li>
      <li>We only send notifications about NEPSE events and updates</li>
      <li>No personal information is shared with the notification service</li>
      <li>Notification data is handled securely by OneSignal according to their privacy policy</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  
  <div class="card">
    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>NEPSE Calendar uses three third-party services: Firebase Remote Config for delivering updated event data, OneSignal for sending push notifications about NEPSE updates, and Google AdMob for displaying advertisements. We do not use any analytics, tracking, or other advertising services. Google AdMob operates according to Google's Privacy Policy, and OneSignal processes only the minimal data necessary for notification delivery.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="card">
    <h2>Your Rights</h2>
    <p>Since we do not collect personal data directly, most data protection rights are not applicable. However, you have the right to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Use the app without providing personal information</li>
      <li>Clear locally stored data by uninstalling the app</li>
      <li>Control advertising personalization through device settings</li>
      <li>Use the app offline without any data transmission</li>
      <li>Contact us with any privacy-related questions</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  
  <div class="card">
    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>
